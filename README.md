# Conversion-of-Expressions-to-Three-Address-Code


Lex & Yacc files for generating three-address code for expressions like
● Assignment Operator: =
● Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /
● Loops: WHILE (Loops are simple and not nested)
● Relational Operators: >, >=, <, <=

● As there is no braces we have done some changes in Input Cases
